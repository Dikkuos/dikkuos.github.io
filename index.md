## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the main dashboard. Here, you can view the ferry timetable and real-time capacity. You can also set up your Telegram notifications in the settings menu.

### Setting Up Notifications

1. Go to the settings page.
2. Enter your Telegram Bot Token.
3. Select the ferry routes you want to monitor.
4. Save your settings.

You will now receive notifications whenever there is a change in capacity.

## How It Works

The Ferry Capacity Monitor fetches data from ferry service APIs. It updates the information in real-time and displays it on the dashboard. The backend is designed to handle multiple requests efficiently, ensuring that users always receive the latest data.

### Data Flow

1. **API Calls**: The application makes periodic API calls to fetch ferry schedules and capacity.
2. **State Management**: The state is managed using React's Context API to ensure all components have access to the latest data.
3. **Notifications**: When capacity changes, the application triggers a notification via the Telegram API.

## Notifications

Notifications are a key feature of the Ferry Capacity Monitor. Users can receive alerts through Telegram whenever:

- A ferry reaches full capacity.
- A new ferry is added to the schedule.
- There are any changes to existing ferry times.

### Setting Up Telegram Notifications

1. Create a Telegram bot using [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
2. Copy the bot token and paste it into the application settings.
3. Select the routes you want to monitor.

You will receive updates directly in your Telegram app, keeping you informed without needing to check the app constantly.
